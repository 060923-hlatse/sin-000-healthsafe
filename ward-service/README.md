# WardServiceApp

## Overview

Provides lists of wards and departments.

Part of the [HealthSafe](../README.md) project. Independent Maven module, no
parent pom.

MQ: this service subscribes to the ActiveMQ topic `staffing-events-topic` — see [`../common/`](../common). Broker URL and topic name come from the common `co.wethinkcode.healthsafe.mq.MqConfig` class alongside it in this module.
